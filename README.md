# ChoresMania - Personal Updated Version

ChoresMania is a continuation of my final computer science project that fascinated me and inspired me to expand on the idea. It is designed as an aesthetically pleasing household management app that helps users organize chores and assignments while also providing a simple grocery tracking feature. Users can create an account with their information and preferences saved, and each account supports up to four household profiles to represent different members. Chores are added to a to-do list, and with a single click, the app randomizes and assigns each chore fairly across profiles. An additional grocery list feature allows households to track items easily, and all graphics were created using Canva to give the app a clean and engaging design. Originally developed as a Java Swing desktop application, ChoresMania is now being revived and modernized into a full-stack web application using React, Node.js, and MongoDB to enhance accessibility and prepare it for public release.
